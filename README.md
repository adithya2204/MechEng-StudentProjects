## Overview

This repository showcases two innovative class projects completed as part of the B.Tech. Automation and Robotics Engineering curriculum at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. The first project, "Dry Mop Cleaner," is a manufacturing lab initiative focused on designing and fabricating a portable, eco-friendly cleaning device with a triangular base and DC motor-driven mop. Emphasizing efficiency, sustainability, and user-friendliness, the project demonstrates practical skills in CAD design, material selection, and mechanical assembly. The second project, "TrackCare," is a design thinking endeavor aimed at developing a wearable GPS tracking system for individuals with memory-related conditions such as amnesia. Integrating real-time location tracking, emergency alerts, and geofencing, TrackCare addresses critical safety and usability needs for both users and caregivers. Both projects reflect a commitment to innovation, hands-on engineering, and societal impact, providing practical solutions to real-world challenges. The repository includes detailed project reports in PDF format, offering insights into the design process, technical challenges, and outcomes. This collection serves as a resource for students, educators, and anyone interested in applied engineering and design thinking in the context of automation and robotics.
